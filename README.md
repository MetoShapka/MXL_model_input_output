# MXL_model_input_output
Model input and output data based on paper Shapkalijevski et al. 2017 (ACP)
This repository contains model input and output data from two case studies based on the paper Shapkalijevski et al. (2017): Integrating canopy and large-scale effects in the convective boundary-layer dynamics during the CHATS experiment.

The two case studies are representation of the boundary-layer dynamics over CHATS (Canopy Horisontal Array Turbulence Study) site on 27 and 31 May 2007 (147 and 151 day of year 2007, respectively) using the mixed-layer model coupled with land-surface model with and without roughness-sublayer representation.

Thus, there are two files, one for each case study: mxlch-chats-147 and mxlch-chats-171.

Inside this files there are files of different numerical experiments, based on Table 1 in Shapkalijevski et al. (2017). Inside these files, the input and output .txt files of the corresponging numerical experiments are places.
